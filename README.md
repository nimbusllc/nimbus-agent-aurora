)

# Execute blockchain operations
async def main():
    # Smart Contract Operations
    contract_address = await engine.deploy_contract(contract_code)
    await engine.validate_contract(contract_address)
    
    # Contract Automation
    await engine.schedule_deployment(contract_code, deployment_time)
    
    # Asset Management
    await engine.stake_assets(amount, duration)
